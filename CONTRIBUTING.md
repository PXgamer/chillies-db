# Contributing

Chillies DB is an open source collection of chillies and accepts contributions to the project.

Contributions can be made in 2 forms, either as an issue or a pull request on the main repository.

Issues are a great way to point out mistakes, changes or generally anything about the project.

If you would like to add a chilli, edit a chilli, or anything else, you are able to do this through a Pull Request.

### Making a pull request

In order to make changes, you will need to do the following:

- Fork the repository using the `Fork` button in the top right
- Clone your repository locally
- Checkout a new branch (name this as what your PR will change. e.g. `feature/scotch-bonnet`)
- Make your changes on that branch, and push it to GitHub.
- Open a pull request, guidance for this can be found here: https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests

If your pull request is valid, we will merge it with the main repository.
